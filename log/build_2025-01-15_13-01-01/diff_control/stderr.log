[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrobot_hardware.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "robot_hardware", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "robot_hardware"
  with any of the following names:

    robot_hardwareConfig.cmake
    robot_hardware-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "robot_hardware" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "robot_hardware_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "robot_hardware" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
