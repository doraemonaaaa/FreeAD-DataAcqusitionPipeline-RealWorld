[33mCMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:32 (add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target usb_camera_node
  because files in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit
  directories:

    runtime library [libcurl.so.4] in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu may be hidden by files in:
      /home/pengyh/softwares/anaconda3/lib
    runtime library [libtiff.so.5] in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu may be hidden by files in:
      /home/pengyh/softwares/anaconda3/lib

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
